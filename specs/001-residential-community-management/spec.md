# Feature Specification: Residential Community Management Platform - Multi-Tenant Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-residential-community-management`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Residential Community Management Platform with 4 specialized applications: Platform (superadmin), Admin (HOA officers), Residence (household management), and Sentinel (security gate management)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Superadmin Creates New Community Tenant (Priority: P1)

A platform superadmin needs to onboard a new residential community (HOA) to the platform by creating a fully isolated tenant with initial configuration, property structure, gate setup, and admin user accounts.

**Why this priority**: This is the absolute foundation of the platform. Without the ability to create and configure tenants, no other features can function. This is the gateway to platform growth and enables all downstream user stories.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a complete tenant from scratch, verifying tenant isolation, and confirming the admin head user can access their dedicated portal. Delivers immediate value by enabling a new community to start using the platform.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in as a platform superadmin, **When** I complete the tenant creation wizard with valid community information, property definitions, gate configurations, and admin user details, **Then** a new isolated tenant is provisioned with its own subdomain, the admin head receives activation credentials via email, and the tenant appears in my management dashboard
2. **Given** a new tenant has been created, **When** the admin head user logs in using their subdomain and credentials, **Then** they can access the admin portal with full permissions to manage households, approve permits, and configure community settings
3. **Given** I am creating a tenant with 100 residential properties, **When** I upload a CSV file with property addresses and attributes, **Then** the system validates all addresses, displays a preview with any errors, and upon confirmation creates all 100 properties with unique identifiers
4. **Given** I have defined 3 gates for a community, **When** I assign RFID readers and set operating hours, **Then** all gates appear in the Sentinel app for security officers and can be used for entry/exit management

---

### User Story 2 - Admin Head Sets Up Households and Issues Vehicle Stickers (Priority: P2)

An admin head (HOA president/chairperson) needs to register households to specific residences, create household head accounts, and approve vehicle sticker requests to enable residents to access the community.

**Why this priority**: Once a tenant exists, the next critical step is populating it with actual residents. This enables the community to start operating and residents to begin using services. This unlocks the resident-facing features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning multiple households to properties, verifying household heads receive login credentials, and confirming residents can request and receive vehicle stickers. Delivers value by enabling resident onboarding and access control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am an admin head with vacant properties, **When** I select a residence and create a household head with email and contact information, **Then** the residence status changes to occupied, an email with login credentials is sent to the household head, and the household appears in my directory
2. **Given** a household head has submitted a vehicle sticker request with vehicle details and registration documents, **When** I review the request and see the household has not exceeded their allocation limit, **Then** I can approve the request, which triggers sticker issuance and links the RFID number to the vehicle plate for gate scanning
3. **Given** I need to onboard 50 households quickly, **When** I upload a CSV file mapping households to residences with contact information, **Then** the system validates all data, sends batch emails with credentials, and I can track the progress of bulk operations

### User Story 3 - Household Manages Family and Requests Services (Priority: P3)

A household head needs to add family members, register beneficial users (helpers/drivers), request construction permits, and schedule guest visits to manage their household's access and services.

**Why this priority**: With households onboarded and vehicle access configured, residents need self-service capabilities to manage their day-to-day needs without constant admin intervention. This reduces admin burden and improves resident satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as a household head, adding family members, requesting services, and verifying approvals flow through the system. Delivers value by enabling resident autonomy and streamlining service requests.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a household head, **When** I add family members with their roles and contact information, **Then** adult members receive app invitations and can log in with their own credentials to view household data and approve guest entries
2. **Given** I need to pre-register a guest for tomorrow's visit, **When** I enter the guest's name, vehicle plate, and visit time, **Then** the guest appears in my pre-registered list and when they arrive at the gate, security can verify them without calling me
3. **Given** I plan to renovate my kitchen, **When** I submit a construction permit request with project details, contractor information, and timeline, **Then** the admin reviews my request, calculates the road fee, I receive an invoice, and upon payment the permit is activated for my registered workers

### User Story 4 - Security Officer Manages Gate Entry/Exit (Priority: P4)

A gate guard uses the Sentinel app to scan resident RFID stickers, verify pre-registered guests, approve walk-in visitors, monitor deliveries, validate construction workers against active permits, and log all entry/exit activity.

**Why this priority**: Security operations are essential for community safety but depend on all previous stories being complete (tenant setup, resident data, vehicle stickers, guest pre-registration, construction permits). This story integrates all data sources for real-time access control.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating various entry scenarios (resident with sticker, pre-registered guest, unregistered visitor, delivery, construction worker) and verifying all are properly logged and tracked. Delivers value by automating gate operations and improving security.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a gate guard on duty, **When** a resident vehicle approaches and I scan their RFID sticker, **Then** the system displays the resident's name and address, automatically opens the barrier, and logs the entry with timestamp
2. **Given** a guest arrives claiming to visit a specific household, **When** I search the pre-registered guest list by name or plate number, **Then** I can verify their ID matches the registration, check them in, and the household receives an arrival notification
3. **Given** an unregistered visitor arrives, **When** I tap "Request Approval" and send a notification to the household, **Then** the household receives a real-time push notification to approve or reject within 2 minutes, and I act based on their response
4. **Given** construction workers arrive for an active permit, **When** I search for the permit by address and verify worker IDs against the registered list, **Then** I can log their entry, take photos for security records, and issue temporary worker passes valid for the permit duration
5. **Given** a delivery driver arrives with a package, **When** I notify the household and they respond to either allow entry or hold at the guard house, **Then** I start a timer for the delivery if allowed entry or log the package in storage if held, sending appropriate notifications

---

### User Story 5 - Admin Communicates and Monitors Community (Priority: P5)

An admin head or officer sends announcements to residents and security personnel, monitors gate activity, reviews incident reports, manages association fees, and maintains community rules and guidelines.

**Why this priority**: Communication and monitoring are important for ongoing operations but are not blocking for basic platform functionality. These features enhance the platform's value after core access control and service workflows are operational.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating announcements with different urgency levels and audiences, tracking read receipts, reviewing entry logs and incident reports, and managing fee schedules. Delivers value by improving communication transparency and operational oversight.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am an admin head, **When** I create an announcement about community pool maintenance, select "All Residents" as the audience, and schedule it for tomorrow at 9:00 AM, **Then** at the scheduled time all residents receive a push notification and the announcement appears in their app's announcement board
2. **Given** I need to set monthly association fees, **When** I configure the fee structure and generate invoices for all households, **Then** each household receives an invoice via email and app notification, can pay online, and receives an auto-generated receipt upon payment
3. **Given** a security officer reports a suspicious person incident, **When** the incident is logged with photos and location, **Then** I receive an immediate notification, can view the incident details and CCTV footage, and can coordinate response or mark it as resolved
4. **Given** I need to update village rules, **When** I create a new rule with an effective date and publish it, **Then** all residents and security personnel receive notifications, the rule appears in their apps, and residents must acknowledge major changes

### Edge Cases

- **Duplicate tenant subdomain**: What happens when a superadmin attempts to create a tenant with a subdomain that already exists? → Display error message and suggest available alternatives
- **Household exceeds sticker allocation**: How does the system handle a household requesting more stickers than allowed? → Auto-reject with override option for admin head approval and clear reason
- **Offline gate operations**: What happens when the Sentinel app loses internet connectivity during peak entry hours? → Enable offline mode with local cache of valid stickers, sync entry logs when connectivity is restored
- **Guest approval timeout**: How does the system handle when a household doesn't respond to a guest approval request within 2 minutes? → Default deny entry and allow guard to call household directly via app
- **Construction permit expiration**: What happens when workers attempt to enter after a permit has expired? → Block entry and notify household that permit requires renewal
- **Delinquent household access**: How should residents with overdue association fees be restricted? → Allow gate access (residents can enter/exit community) but restrict new service requests (cannot request new stickers, construction permits, or register new guests) until fees are current. Admin can configure stricter policies per community if needed.
- **Multi-day guest overstay**: How should the system handle guests who exceed their registered visit duration? → Send alert to household and security, require household to either extend the stay or request guest departure
- **Tenant data migration**: What happens when a community wants to migrate existing resident data from spreadsheets or other systems? → Support bulk import with validation, duplicate detection, and rollback capability
- **Emergency gate override**: How do security officers handle power failures or system emergencies? → Provide manual override mode with emergency full-open capability, log all manual actions for audit
