## Notes

**Clarification Resolved**:
- **Edge Case - Delinquent household access**: ✅ Resolved with Option A
  - Policy: Allow gate access but restrict new service requests (stickers, permits, guests) until fees are current
  - Admin can configure stricter policies per community if needed
  - Updated in spec.md line 101 and Assumptions section

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION COMPLETE AND VALIDATED**

All quality criteria pass. The specification is comprehensive, technology-agnostic, and ready for implementation planning.

**Next Step**: Run `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.
