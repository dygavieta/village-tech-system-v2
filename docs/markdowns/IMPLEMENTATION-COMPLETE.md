## ⚠️ Known Limitations (MVP Simplifications)

1. **Permit Payment**: Simplified - no Stripe integration yet
   - Road fees displayed but payment handled manually
   - Admin sets fees, residents see amount
   - Future: Add Stripe payment flow (T109 full implementation)

2. **Admin Permit Approval**: Basic page exists (T089f) but needs enhancement
   - T111-T112 can add approval workflow UI
   - Edge Function `approve-permit` is ready to use

3. **No Push Notifications Yet**: Residents won't get real-time alerts
   - Feature exists in codebase but needs configuration
   - Future: Configure flutter_local_notifications

4. **No Stripe Integration**: Payment features are placeholders
   - Future: Integrate flutter_stripe package
   - Future: Set up Stripe webhooks

## 🎁 Bonus: What's Already Built But Not Listed

Your previous team completed even more than documented:
- ✅ Complete authentication for all apps
- ✅ Material 3 theming for mobile apps
- ✅ Shadcn/ui for web apps
- ✅ All navigation structures
- ✅ Error handling utilities
- ✅ All RLS policies and database migrations
- ✅ Admin app has 15+ fully functional pages (households, gates, rules, monitoring, etc.)

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Deployment)
1. **Test all 4 critical flows above** ✅
2. **Fix any bugs found during testing**
3. **Configure environment variables** (.env files for each app)
4. **Test on real devices** (not just emulator)

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Enhance Admin Permit Approval** (T111-T112)
   - Add approval card component
   - Create server action to call approve-permit Edge Function
   - Add road fee calculator UI

2. **Deploy to Staging**:
   ```bash
   # Web apps
   cd apps/platform && vercel --prod
   cd apps/admin && vercel --prod

   # Mobile apps
   cd apps/residence
   flutter build apk --release  # Android
   flutter build ios --release  # iOS (requires Mac + Apple Developer account)
   ```

3. **Onboard First Real Community**:
   - Use Platform app to create tenant
   - Import real property data
   - Configure gates
   - Create admin user
   - Train admin on system

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. **Add Sentinel App** (Phase 6) - Gate security operations
2. **Add Communication Features** (Phase 7) - Announcements, fees, rules
3. **Production Polish** (Phase 8) - Error boundaries, loading states, accessibility
4. **Comprehensive Testing** (Phase 9) - Unit tests, E2E tests, coverage

## 🏆 Success Metrics

Your MVP is successful if:
- ✅ Residents can use the mobile app without calling admin
- ✅ Admins save 50%+ time on household management
- ✅ All household services are self-service
- ✅ Zero cross-tenant data leakage (RLS working)
- ✅ Admins approve requests within 24 hours

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Residence app won't connect to Supabase
**Fix**: Check `.env` file has correct `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

**Issue**: File uploads fail
**Fix**: Verify Supabase Storage bucket `documents` exists with proper RLS policies

**Issue**: Member/sticker/guest/permit not showing
**Fix**: Check household_id is correctly fetched in `currentHouseholdIdProvider`

**Issue**: Admin can't see pending requests
**Fix**: Verify RLS policies allow admin role to view all data in their tenant

### Development Commands
```bash
# Flutter
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run

# Supabase
supabase status
supabase db reset
supabase functions serve

# Next.js
npm run dev
npm run build
```
