## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Deploy Current MVP (Recommended)
Your system is now functional enough to deploy and test with real users!

1. **Test the critical flow**:
   ```bash
   # Residence app
   cd apps/residence
   flutter run

   # Test: Add family member → Request sticker → Check status
   ```

2. **Deploy to staging**:
   ```bash
   # Platform app
   cd apps/platform
   vercel --prod

   # Admin app
   cd apps/admin
   vercel --prod

   # Mobile apps
   cd apps/residence
   flutter build apk --release  # Android
   flutter build ios --release   # iOS (requires Mac)
   ```

3. **Create test data**:
   - Create a tenant via Platform app
   - Create households via Admin app
   - Log in as household head in Residence app
   - Test the complete flow

### Option 2: Add Guest/Permit Features (1-2 hours)

1. Create simplified guest screens (T103-T105)
2. Create simplified permit screens (T106-T109)
3. Create admin permit approval page (T110-T112)

### Option 3: Continue with Sentinel App (3-4 hours)
