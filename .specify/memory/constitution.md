# Village Tech System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality, Testing Standards, User Experience Consistency, and Performance Requirements

**Clean Code** — All code MUST be self-documenting with clear naming, minimal complexity (McCabe < 10), and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.

**Code Review** — All changes MUST pass peer review before merging; reviewers MUST verify constitutional compliance.

**Static Analysis** — All code MUST pass linting, type checking, and static analysis with zero warnings.

**Documentation** — Public APIs, complex algorithms, and architectural decisions MUST be documented inline and in design documents.

**No Dead Code** — Commented-out code, unused imports, and unreachable functions are forbidden; delete instead of commenting out.

**Testing Standards** — Enforce unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests across all modules with automated CI checks.

**User Experience Consistency** — Ensure a unified experience across all platforms, maintaining design alignment and predictable interaction patterns.

**Performance Requirements** — Optimize for speed, scalability, and stability, targeting under 2-second load times for all core operations.

**Rationale**: Code quality directly impacts maintainability, reliability, and long-term velocity. These standards are non-negotiable foundations for sustainable software delivery.

### II. UX & Design Principles

**Accessibility First** — Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as the minimum standard.

**Mobile-First, Responsive Layouts** — Design interfaces that scale elegantly across all devices.

**Visual Hierarchy and Minimalism** — Prioritize clarity, readability, and simplicity in every layout.

**Design Tokens** — Use standardized spacing, color, and typography tokens for global consistency.

**Dark Mode Support** — Provide a fully functional dark theme for accessibility and comfort.

**Golden Ratio Application** — Apply proportional harmony in spacing and composition wherever applicable.

**Icon Consistency** — Use only icons from the approved library or package.

**Rationale**: Consistent, accessible design ensures all users can effectively interact with the system regardless of ability, device, or environment. These principles establish the foundation for inclusive user experiences.

### III. Backend (Supabase) Principles

**Security First** — Enforce Row-Level Security (RLS) and least privilege access for all data operations.

**Scalable Architecture** — Design databases and APIs to handle high concurrency and large datasets.

**Type Safety** — Use TypeScript consistently across all Supabase edge functions and backend logic.

**Optimized Data Modeling** — Apply normalized schema design for efficient and maintainable relationships.

**Performance Monitoring** — Continuously track query performance, caching efficiency, and response times.

**Modular Structure** — Organize functions and business logic into reusable, decoupled modules.

**Error Handling and Logging** — Implement structured logging, retries, and error boundaries for resilience.

**Continuous Integration/Deployment** — Automate tests, migrations, and versioning in all release workflows.

**Data Privacy and Compliance** — Adhere to local and international data protection standards (e.g., GDPR, DPA).

**Rationale**: Backend systems are the foundation of application security, performance, and reliability. These principles ensure data integrity, user privacy, and system resilience at scale.

### IV. Mobile (Flutter) Principles

**Clean Architecture** — Follow MVVM or BLoC pattern for maintainable, testable codebases.

**Cross-Platform Consistency** — Maintain feature and visual parity across iOS, Android, and web.

**Responsive and Adaptive Layouts** — Ensure proper scaling for varying screen sizes and orientations.

**State Management** — Use consistent and scalable approaches (e.g., Riverpod, Provider, Bloc).

**Type Safety** — Implement null safety and type-safe Dart code across all modules.

**Performance Optimization** — Minimize widget rebuilds, reduce tree depth, and optimize rendering.

**Consistent Theming** — Apply shared design tokens for typography, color, and spacing.

**Offline Support** — Provide caching and graceful fallback behavior during connectivity loss.

**Accessibility Compliance** — Follow Flutter's official accessibility guidelines.

**Automated Testing** — Integrate unit, widget, and integration tests within CI/CD workflows.

**Rationale**: Mobile applications are often the primary user touchpoint. These principles ensure reliability, performance, and maintainability across all supported platforms.

## Development Standards

### Code Organization

All features MUST be organized according to the project structure defined in implementation plans. Code organization MUST prioritize:

- Clear separation of concerns (models, services, UI, tests)
- Modular, reusable components
- Minimal coupling between modules
- Explicit dependencies

### Dependency Management

- All dependencies MUST be explicitly declared and version-pinned
- Dependencies MUST be reviewed for security vulnerabilities before adoption
- Transitive dependencies MUST be audited regularly
- Deprecated dependencies MUST be replaced within one release cycle

### Version Control Practices

- Commits MUST be atomic and represent single logical changes
- Commit messages MUST follow conventional commit format
- Feature branches MUST be short-lived (< 5 days)
- All code MUST be reviewed before merging to main branch

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Requirements

Before any code is committed, the following MUST be verified:

1. All linters pass with zero warnings
2. All type checks pass
3. No commented-out code remains
4. No unused imports or dead code exists

### Pre-Merge Requirements

Before any feature branch is merged, the following MUST be verified:

1. All automated tests pass
2. Code review approval received
3. Constitutional compliance verified by reviewer
4. Documentation updated for public API changes
5. Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 2s load time)

### Pre-Release Requirements

Before any release to production, the following MUST be verified:

1. All integration and E2E tests pass
2. Security audit completed
3. Performance profiling completed
4. Accessibility compliance verified (WCAG 2.1 AA)
5. Migration plan documented (if applicable)

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. Proposed amendments MUST be documented with rationale
2. Amendments MUST receive approval from project maintainers
3. Breaking amendments MUST include migration plan
4. All amendments MUST be versioned according to semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible governance changes or principle removals
   - **MINOR**: New principles added or materially expanded guidance
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

- All pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance before approval
- Complexity that violates constitutional principles MUST be explicitly justified
- Unjustified violations MUST be rejected in code review
- Reviewers MUST document justifications for approved complexity

### Version Control

This constitution is versioned using semantic versioning. All changes MUST update the version line below and document the change in the Sync Impact Report.

### Enforcement

This constitution supersedes all other development practices, guidelines, and conventions. When conflicts arise between this constitution and other documentation, the constitution takes precedence.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-10 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-10
